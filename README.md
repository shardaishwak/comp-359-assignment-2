### Requirements

### Planning

- Readme file: dividing the tasks, requirements, rubric and general progress of each user.
- Github: for keeping track of the code files, versioning, branching and issues.
  - Java Repository: https://github.com/shardaishwak/comp-359-assignment-1-java
  - Typescript Respository: https://github.com/shardaishwak/comp-359-assignment-1
- Github Board -We primary used Roadmap Check it out at: [https://github.com/users/shardaishwak/projects/1/views/4](https://github.com/users/shardaishwak/projects/1/views/4)

### Submission model

- Powerpoint presentation: describing briefly all the algorithms, space and time complexity, research involved and the specialty.

### Source:

### Technologies required

- Python

## Algorithms

### Test suitcase

To ensure that our implementations of the algorithms are correct, we can develop a test suitcase to run on each algorithm. This suitcase makes sure that all the algorithms do sort accordingly given some input.

## Rubric

10 marks total (marked individually per team member)

- [1 mark] plan and logging of work
  - e.g., git log and Kanban task board
- [2 marks] references / citations
  - e.g., any format will be fine, APA, MLA, etc.
  - place in [README.md](http://readme.md/) file if code, or place at end of report in bibliography
- **[1 mark] apply the analysis framework, or collect others’ analysis results**
- [4 marks] one of the following
  - implementation,
  - or statistical experiment,
  - or writing about a collection of topics surrounding a data structure / problem
    - majority of the writing is yours---not simply copying quotes / AI as filler
- note that members of group can overlap in choice, but then must use different
  algorithm / implementation, or different programming language, or different computer
  hardware comparison, or different subtopic - in other words, not duplicating someone else’s work
- **[2 marks] debugging / testing code, or logical reasoning in your writing**
